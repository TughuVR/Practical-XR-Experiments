Workings:

Increase Volume to hear

Exported sound it wasn't sounding loud enough
so changed volume control settings in preference - Under appreance and mdeia section I changed the [item volume handle: from +0dB is top of  item to +0dB is center of item]. that changed the volume control from the top place the volume control line in the middle. With this I was able to increase the volume beyond the limits of the previous control. Allowing me get louder sound I could hear for my work.

Disabled grid lines to allow the tracks to slide on the tinmeline to I could adjust it as I wanted.

Adjusted the volume to each item so they could blend nicely together.

Included a clipping sound but at a reduced volume.

Reduced master volume to -9.64dB. I don't want it too loud in the app.
