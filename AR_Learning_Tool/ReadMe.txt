Goal: I want to learn how to create an interactive learning tool 
for children that is engaging and fun to use.

I want it to be easily accessible to them using what is currently
available to them, without having to pay top dollar for new hardware.

Primary Focus: Learn how to create AR interactivity and engagement.
